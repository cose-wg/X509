It was only a suspicion, but after some sleuthing it appears I was incorrect.\r\n\r\nI dug through the revision history of RFC 7515 (draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature).  Revision 15 added the first relevant text to Section 6 that \"header parameters MUST be integrity protected if the information about the key that they convey is to be considered trusted.\"  I could not find any discussion on the mailing list other than the statement by Mike Jones (https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/jose/klG-D3Rm9V7BkJbgPLI6SQELaXM/) that the revision was addressing issues filed by Jim Schaad and that Mike and Jim worked on it offline.  According to the document history, the updates to Section 6 were addressing issues #104, #105, #106 (e.g. https://trac.ietf.org/trac/jose/ticket/106), which were concerns regarding jku, jwk and x5u.  Concerns regarding x5t were raised in issue #107, but claimed to be \"Fixed - kind of by #104\".  Concerns regarding trust of x5c was not raised--issue #108 is about the processing of x5c. \r\n\r\nThe next update to this text in Section 6 was in Revision 37.  This revision added the text \"however, if the only information used in the trust decision is a key, these parameters need not be integrity protected, since changing them in a way that causes a different key to be used will cause the validation to fail.\"  This additional text seems to be based on a proposed clarification from Richard Barnes during IESG review (https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/jose/YWje0hfyhEpNG9Fs8TkcliP-XaU/).  That thread is very interesting and I believe discusses the concerns that Laurence has raised in this Issue.\r\n\r\nI won't list all the points raised in that thread, but I will note that they reference risks described in RFC 2634, Section 5.  It appears from that thread that the necessity of integrity protecting the x5t and x5c headers was still actively being debated:\r\n  \"issue #104 was closed without any discussion on the list (AFAICT).  And that issue only related to 'jku', so the extension to all the other fields is unnecessary.\"\r\n\r\nIn the message from Richard where he proposed the text (https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/jose/YWje0hfyhEpNG9Fs8TkcliP-XaU/), he explicitly states that the reason for it is if the \"content of a key identifier... is used for security decisions\".  Therefore, I still don't believe that the requirement to integrity protect applies to certificates in an x5c header.  Under the attack scenario discussed, the trust decision is the certificate chain validation as per RFC 7515, Appendix D, Item 4; Richard points out in \"[1]\" that if the attacker has compromised the identity in this way (i.e. the certificate issuer) then the attacker \"can provision whatever key he wants, and re-sign the message.\"  ",

I don't think the headers parameters should always be protected.\r\n\r\nThe attacks at issue are possible even when path validation was performed and succeeded. The protection of the headers is never an alternate to path validation.\r\n\r\nAs the 7515 discussion mentions identification of a key versus identification of a certificate is an important distinction. I understand this to be an issue because a certificate contains data in addition to the key that affects the ultimate trust decision. For example basic constraints, path length, key usage, the subject and so on. The signer presumably choose the particular certificate because they want this additional data in there certificate processed during validation.\r\n\r\nIt's true the attacker can't change these because the certificate is signed and checked by path validation, but it is possible that there are two different certificates with the same key that vary in other ways. The subject could be different. The key usage could be different and so on. That two certificates like this exists seems like questionable CA practice, but that is besides the point here.\r\n\r\nIf some second certificate with the same key happens to exist and the fields in it are somehow favorable for an attack, there is opportunity to reference it if the header is not protected.

Since trust relationships are of critical importance in what we're doing here, I would expect it to be spelled out. \r\n\r\nIt seems like there's two roots of trust involved here. One for the chain that is used to verify the COSE and the other that is used to verify the TLS connection.\r\n\r\nI think the following sentence refers to the root of trust for the TLS connection, but can be confused with the root of trust for the COSE chain.\r\n\r\n> If the retrieved certificate does not\r\n      chain to an existing trust anchor, the certificate MUST NOT be\r\n      trusted unless the server is configured as trusted to provide new\r\n      trust anchors or if an out-of-band confirmation can be received\r\n      for trusting the retrieved certificate.\r\n\r\nAlso, maybe there should be a protected header that names the root of trust for the TLS connection? If there isn't the signer can't quite control the trust relationship as they don't know what roots the receiver has been configured with.\r\n\r\nI also think it is important to point out that the certs received this way must still be validated against the root used by the COSE chain. This is not the fetching of already-validate certificates.\r\n\r\nJWS seems to have similar issues.\r\n\r\n",

There is a lot of cases where people believe that just because they have HTTPS everything is secure and trusted. \r\n\r\nIn general, I don't really se why x5u needs to be handled differently from x5t, x5chain, and x5bag. For x5u, x5bag, x5chain the information is untrusted, the receiver has to verify the certificate chain and any updates of the trust anchors requires out of band confirmation. On on-path attacker can modify the information in x5t, x5bag, x5chain like the HTTP server can modify x5u. I don't see why the trusted header and TLS are needed in this case. HTTP is just anohter way to get untrusted certificate information....\r\n\r\nIf x5u is intended to be used instead of chain validation or intended to distibute new root certs, this is not well described. In both these cases the most important trust relation is between the reciever of the x5u parameter and the HTTPS sever. The reciever need to have as much trust in the HTTPS server as it has in its trust anchors or even in the entity its providing trust anchors.\r\n\r\nI think the use cases and requirements for each use case need to be clearly defined. Right now I don't even understand what the use cases for x5u are.\r\n\r\n- Provide untrusted cert information like x5bag, x5chain, x5t?\r\n- Provide trusted cert information that does not need to be verified with a trust anchor?\r\n- Provide new trust anchors?",

The solution is to use x5t together with the other parameters as suggested by Russ:\r\n\r\n- Added to x5bag, x5chain, and x5u that integrity protection in COSE is requiured unless it is known that the CA did proof-of-possession.\r\n- Added that integrity protection can be achieved by combining x5t with x5bag, x5chain, or x5u.  \r\n- Added explanation that sending x5bag or x5cahing in unprotected allows an intermediary to remove or add certificates.\r\n- Added clarification that x5t refer to an end-entity certificate.\r\n- Added media type application/cbor for a COSE_X509 chain.\r\n- Added that when the end-entity certificate is intergrity protected by COSE, URI protection is not needed.\r\n- Security consideration on why integrity protection of the end-entity certificate is required is there was no proof-of-possession.\r\n- Security consideration on identity protection.\r\n\r\nI think this addresses all the related use case and security issues.\r\n - If the requirement are followed, it is secure.\r\n - No changes required to existing secure deployments.\r\n - It is still possible to send x5bag and x5chain in uprotected.\r\n - No extra overhead is required when used in EDHOC.\r\n - When used in EDHOC, plain unprotected CoAP can be used.\r\n\r\nI tried to make the changnes so that no existing secure deployment need to change their implementation. Could otherwise discussed if integrity protection should be a MUST, but that would change existing implementaions (which is they do proof-of-possession are already secure).",
